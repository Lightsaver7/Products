About the product
-----------------

STEMlab 125-14 4 Inputs is based on STEMlab 125-14 board, but instead of 2 inputs and 2 output channels offers 4 Input channels that with improved performance. 

STEMlab 125-14 4-Input single-board RF signal acquisition platform that offers the same general hardware features as STEMlab 125-14. 

The main differences/benefits are that:

    * There are 4 analog input channels @ 125 Msps & 14 bits (instead of 2 inputs and 2 outputs)  
    * RF inputs come with better performance (less crosstalk, noise, and distortions) 
    * Zynq 7020 (bigger FPGA that offers more processing capabilities and more digital IO pins available on the extension connector) 
    * Switching between internal and external clock can be done using a jumper or control signal on the extension connector 
    * Possibility to lock internal ADC clock to external reference clock provided through extension connector* 

*This feature is only available on customer requests.
