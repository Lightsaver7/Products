About the product
-----------------

SIGNALlab 250-12 is most sophisticated Red Pitaya product, built for more demanding industrial applications and research, where robustness and performance matter more than cost.

All SIGNALlab 250-12 products are now equipped with PoE (power over ethernet), which provides the possibility of powering and communicating with SIGNALlab using over one single ethernet cable. It saves time and costs of installation by reducing the time and expense of having electrical power cabling installed and is also safer due to intelligent POE delivery that is designed to protect network equipment from incorrect installation, overloads, or underpowering.

The device has full software control over the hardware and additional hardware features compared to other Red Pitaya products. Its larger Xilinx Zynq 7020 FPGA enables greater real-time processing capabilities plus a faster 250 Msps sampling rate, and just like other Red Pitaya products it offers the benefits of remote access, with an online app user interface accessible through Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
