About the product
-----------------

.. warning::

    This board needs an external clock signal 122.88 MHz in order to boot and function!

SDRlab 122-16 External clock is based on the SDRlab 122-16 model that is modified to be used with an external clock oscillator, which is important especially for RF applications that operate at other frequencies, require better quality clock or clock synchronization.

With this modification, users can provide their own clock for the Red Pitaya device through the E2 extension connector.


SDRlab 122-16 was developed specifically for software-defined radio and more demanding RF applications. It is tailored for SDR & other RF applications, HF and 50 MHz bands.

It comes with two 16-bit 50-ohm inputs and two 14-bit 50-ohm outputs, Xilinx Zynq 7020 FPGA for real-time processing capabilities plus an ultra-low phase noise 122.88 MHz clock which makes it more hardware-compatible with HPSDR compliant applications. RF inputs are optimized for minimal distortion, noise and crosstalk which significantly improves reception and broadens the choice of antenna.

The board has no DC coupling, with a minimun input frequency (-3 dB) of 300 kHz.
