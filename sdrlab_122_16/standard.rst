About the product
-----------------

SDRlab 122-16 was developed specifically for software-defined radio and more demanding RF applications. It is tailored for SDR & other RF applications, HF and 50 MHz bands.

It comes with two 16-bit 50-ohm inputs and two 14-bit 50-ohm outputs, Xilinx Zynq 7020 FPGA for real-time processing capabilities plus an ultra-low phase noise 122.88 MHz clock which makes it more hardware-compatible with HPSDR compliant applications. RF inputs are optimized for minimal distortion, noise and crosstalk which significantly improves reception and broadens the choice of antenna.

The board has no DC coupling, with a minimun input frequency (-3 dB) of 300 kHz.
